# Wordle
A version of the newly popular game "Wordle" that is playable from the command line. It uses the same word lists as the official game! Lists found [here](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/cdcdf777450c5b5301e439061d29694c) and [here](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman/a03ef2cba789d8cf00c08f767e0fad7b).

### How to play  
The objective of the game is to guess the five-letter word correctly in 6 tries. After each guess, you will be told which of the letters are in the word and if they are in the correct spot or not. 

Here is an example of a full playthrough of one round of Wordle:
